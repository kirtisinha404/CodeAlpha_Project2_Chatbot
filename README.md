# CodeAlpha_Project2_Chatbot

This is a very basic chatbot built with python. 
It uses python library NLTK(natural language tool kit).
There are pre-defined set of chats for learning of the chatbot.
This chatbot can handle simple conversations by recognizing patterns in user input and providing appropriate responses.


It project was given to me within my internship with CodeAlpha.
